      <h2>About Me </h2>
      <section>
      <p>Being able to create and design web pages means being able to transform the very way people view and regard the Internet. Understanding the functionality of many websites we use daily and possessing the ability to improve upon those sites and interfaces is as rewarding as it is challenging, as is interacting and working with the diverse and dynamic individuals that share a passion for problem-solving and shaping the future of web development.

      In addition to software development, I enjoy physical fitness and the outdoors. I also maintain my sense of creativity through my drag queen alter ego. My passion for social justice, particularly in the realm of LGBT+ and minority rights, has me involved in various local organizations as well.
